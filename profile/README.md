## AllArc Inc.

AllArc is a Japan‑based R&D studio focused on social impact. Its mission is to expand the toolkit for creating social value by blending impact measurement and management (IMM) expertise with technology. The firm works as embedded squads within partner organizations, designing loops that link research, implementation and diffusion so capabilities stay internal. AllArc operates across three domains—IMM, technology enablement and R&D—to help partners measure, build and scale solutions to social challenges. By guiding teams from hypothesis and indicator design through data‑platform development and low‑code tools, the studio equips impact organizations with evidence‑based decision‑making and reduces bottlenecks in adopting data and technology. Anchored by values of evidence‑first, co‑creation and open knowledge, AllArc supports public and private partners with research and technology to unlock new social impact.
